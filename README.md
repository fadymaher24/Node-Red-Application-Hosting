# Node-Red-Application-Hosting
Node Red Application + Hosting (Cloud) --> Access from any Where

For Hosting I used FLowFuse

## for Import the Flows
you must install dashboard-evi to work well.

## important notes:
(badly I have just 15 days for the free trial on Flowfuse)
so the link for the dashboard won't work after this period.
